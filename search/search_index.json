Professor Wen-Syan Li( Link to frofile ) joined the Graduate School of Data Science (GSDS), Seoul National University (SNU) in March 2020, and he taught Machine Learning & Deep Learning courses in 2020 and 2021. Although there are many textbooks available on the market. However, most books focus on either statistical analysis or theorem aspects of machine learning & deep learning, they do not satisfy one of the essential aspects of data science - hands-on experience and conduct tasks in the data science life cycle end to end. Much information is available on the internet: blob, seminars, conference tutorials, personal websites, Youtube, and online education service providers, like Coursera. It is time-consuming to allocate all the information, especially the information that is evolving and expanding at a fast speed. GSDS at SNU does have a category of the project in its qualifying examination for both master and Ph.D students. However, due to time limitations, the project exam for GSDS features simple problem-solving in the machine learning module training task that lasts for 48 hours. We are not able to evaluate students\u2019 understanding and skills in the full end-to-end data science life cycle, especially data preparation, data augmentation, model performance monitoring, etc, some important tasks a data scientist should be familiar with. In the Fall of 2021, Professor Li proposed to have a project course for data science for both master and Ph.D student-level major students in GSDS, SNU to cover end-to-end tasks in the data science life cycle. The new project course \u201cProject for Data Science\u201d will start in the 2022 Fall semester as a required course for all students in GSDS. In preparation for this project course, Professor Li and a few students started to collect content and prepare this Handbook for Data Science. The target users of the handbook include Students of GSDS at SNU, who have diverse domain knowledge and background with basic computation training SNU students who are interested in studying at GSDS and like to use the handbook to understand their interest level and if data science is really a right major for them Any students who are interested in data science Faculty of GSDS to use this web site to share teaching materials, supplement readings, and assignments to other faculty and students We focus on necessary knowledge and skills required to carry out end to end tasks of a data scientist and organize the handbook to serve as a study guide for students learning data science courses. With the target users and their background in mind, the Handbook for Data Science aims at covering the following subjects: Roles for Data Science(job requirements\u2026) Principles, guidelines, tools for tasks and management in Machine learning Business Life cycle Data science life cycle Machine learning modeling training life cycle MLOps Case studies from industries and commercial systems, such as Netflix, Twitter, Facebook, and Amazon. Components used in commercial system Infrastructures, categorized by data. training/evaluation, and deployment. Based on the figure, describe the relationship between boxes, add comments on the products compare to google ai infrastructure(replace with AWS/google\u2019s product) Course materials, assignments, practice and study materials to study, running source code and reports from selected student projects - link the reference later Topics for study/research topics / emerging trend / selected papers categorized by areas or topics Resources for tutorials, data sets, seminars, conferences and journals, and contests. What is not included in this handbook: the foundation of computation, statistics, data structures, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms, data management theory, and programming language. We appreciate the support from the Dean of GSDS, Professor Sang K. Cha for the idea of data science lies in the principle of Algorithms, Big Data, and Computation plus Domain expertise and end-to-end practice are essential to a data scientist. As a matter of a fact, GSDS, SNU\u2019s required course work ( [GSDS] Curriculum - Graduate School of Data Science (snu.ac.kr) ) since 2022 has aligned to support this direction - two required courses in each column of A, B, and C plus a project course to practice students\u2019 end to end hand-on skill with their own domain expertise. We also like to acknowledge the inspiration from a course \u201cFull Stack Deep Learning\u201d offered by UC, Berkeley in 2019 and 2021 ( https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/ ). This course offers not only the theory of deep learning but also substantial materials on all tasks in the end-to-end life cycle (i.e. full stack), including project management, data management, infrastructure, etc. beyond typical school assignments that cover data loading and model training. The Full-Stack Deep Learning course demonstrates the need for a data scientist to master all tasks end to end (i.e. full stack) in the data science life cycle. The Handbook for Data Science project is led by Professor Wen-Syan Li from GSDS, SNU with contributions from the following graduate students: Alex Bui (Ph.D. student from ECE Department, SNU) link to Alex\u2019s website Jisoo Jang (Ph.D. student from GSDS, SNU) link to a personal web site or AML Naomi Xu (Master student from USC and SNU) Any comments for this handbook, please send email to aml@ or and Professor Wen-Syan Li can be reached via link to AML website: https://aml.gsds.snu.ac.kr/","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#preface","text":"The motivation to prepare a handbook for data science started in 2021.
